  abstract = {Abstract             Parasites can shape the structure and function of ecosystems by influencing both the density and traits of their hosts. Such changes in ecosystems are particularly likely when the host is a predator that mediates the dynamics of trophic cascades. Here, we experimentally tested how parasite load of a small predatory fish, the threespine stickleback, can affect the occurrence and strength of trophic cascades and ecosystem functioning. In a factorial mesocosm experiment, we manipulated the density of stickleback (low vs. high), and the level of parasite load (natural vs. reduced). In addition, we used two stickleback populations from different lineages: an eastern European lineage with a more pelagic phenotype (Lake Constance) and a western European lineage with a more benthic phenotype (Lake Geneva). We found that stickleback caused trophic cascades in the pelagic but not the benthic food chain. Evidence for pelagic trophic cascades was stronger in treatments where parasite load of stickleback was reduced with an antihelmintic medication, and where fish originated from Lake Constance (i.e., the more pelagic lineage). A structural equation~model revealed that differences in stickleback lineage and parasite load were most likely to impact trophic cascades via changes in the composition, rather than overall biomass, of zooplankton communities. Overall, our results provide experimental evidence that parasites of predators can influence the cascading effects of fish on lower trophic levels with consequences on ecosystem functioning.},

Recent experimental laboratory studies have focused on the immune responses of hosts to infection, the consequences of infection for the growth and reproductive development of host fish and the effects of infection on host behaviour.

  abstract = {Abstract             Food chain theory is one of the cornerstones of ecology, providing many of its basic predictions, such as biomass pyramids, trophic cascades and predator–prey oscillations. Yet, ninety years into this theory, the conditions under which these patterns may occur and persist in nature remain subject to debate. Rather than address each pattern in isolation, we propose that they must be understood together, calling for synthesis in a fragmented landscape of theoretical and empirical results. As a first step, we propose a minimal theory that combines the long‐standing energetic and dynamical approaches of food chains. We chart theoretical predictions on a concise map, where two main regimes emerge: across various functioning and stability metrics, one regime is characterised by pyramidal patterns and the other by cascade patterns. The axes of this map combine key physiological and ecological variables, such as metabolic rates and self‐regulation. A quantitative comparison with data sheds light on conflicting theoretical predictions and empirical puzzles, from size spectra to causes of trophic cascade strength. We conclude that drawing systematic connections between various existing approaches to food chains, and between their predictions on functioning and stability, is a crucial step in confronting this theory to real ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Future challenges in manufacturing will require automation systems with robots that are increasingly autonomous, flexible, and hopefully equipped with learning capabilities. The flexibility of production processes can be increased by using a combination of a flexible human worker and intelligent automation systems. The adoption of middleware software such as ROS2, the second generation of the Robot Operating System, can enable robots, automation systems, and humans to work together on tasks that require greater autonomy and flexibility. This paper has a twofold objective. Firstly, it provides an extensive review of existing literature on the features and tools currently provided by ROS2 and its main fields of application, in order to highlight the enabling aspects for the implementation of modular architectures to increase autonomy in industrial operations. Secondly, it shows how this is currently potentially feasible in ROS2 by proposing a possible high-level and modular architecture to increase autonomy in industrial operations. A proof of concept is also provided, where the ROS2-based framework is used to enable a cobot equipped with an external depth camera to perform a flexible pick-and-place task.},

  abstract = {Significance             Anthropogenic effects on the environment are ubiquitous and have enormous impacts on individual and ecosystem health. It is widely accepted that environmental change affects disease distribution, but how it may affect parasite-driven evolution remains elusive. Our results provide experimental evidence that parasites play a major role in ecosystem dynamics and, as a result, can affect selection in subsequent host generations. This role is further modified by the prevailing environmental conditions that affect disease dynamics in two ways: through altered ecological opportunities for disease and through altered evolutionary effects on the host.           ,                             Host resistance to parasites is a rapidly evolving trait that can influence how hosts modify ecosystems. Eco-evolutionary feedbacks may develop if the ecosystem effects of host resistance influence selection on subsequent host generations. In a mesocosm experiment, using a recently diverged ({$<$}100 generations) pair of lake and stream three-spined sticklebacks, we tested how experimental exposure to a common fish parasite (               Gyrodactylus               spp.) affects interactions between hosts and their ecosystems in two environmental conditions (low and high nutrients). In both environments, we found that stream sticklebacks were more resistant to               Gyrodactylus               and had different gene expression profiles than lake sticklebacks. This differential infection led to contrasting effects of sticklebacks on a broad range of ecosystem properties, including zooplankton community structure and nutrient cycling. These ecosystem modifications affected the survival, body condition, and gene expression profiles of a subsequent fish generation. In particular, lake juvenile fish suffered increased mortality in ecosystems previously modified by lake adults, whereas stream fish showed decreased body condition in stream fish-modified ecosystems. Parasites reinforced selection against lake juveniles in lake fish-modified ecosystems, but only under oligotrophic conditions. Overall, our results highlight the overlapping timescales and the interplay of host–parasite and host–ecosystem interactions. We provide experimental evidence that parasites influence host-mediated effects on ecosystems and, thereby, change the likelihood and strength of eco-evolutionary feedbacks.},

  abstract = {Agent-based modeling is a simulation method in which autonomous agents interact with their environment and one another, given a predefined set of rules. It is an integral method for modeling and simulating complex systems, such as socio-economic problems. Since agent-based models are not described by simple and concise mathematical equations, the code that generates them is typically complicated, large, and slow. Here we present Agents.jl, a Julia-based software that provides an ABM analysis platform with minimal code complexity. We compare our software with some of the most popular ABM software in other programming languages. We find that Agents.jl is not only the most performant but also the least complicated software, providing the same (and sometimes more) features as the competitors with less input required from the user. Agents.jl also integrates excellently with the entire Julia ecosystem, including interactive applications, differential equations, parameter optimization, and so on. This removes any “extensions library” requirement from Agents.jl, which is paramount in many other tools.},

  abstract = {Parasites are able to influence intermediate hosts in a way that optimizes their growth and transmission to the next host.               Macrocyclops albidus               (Copepoda) suffer from a reduced escaping ability and an increased level of general activity, when infected with               Schistocephalus solidus               (Cestoda). This facilitates predation by the subsequent host, the three-spined stickleback. However, instead of adaptive host manipulation by the tapeworm, the altered copepod behaviour might be explained more simply as a constraint of the infection. Energy depletion could lead to decreased muscle performance and increased food searching activity. Furthermore, resource allocation among host tissues might change after infection. We therefore analysed the amount of storage lipids and muscle tissue before and after experimental infection. To determine the amount of muscles, we developed a new polarization-microscopic technique. Irrespective of infection, lipids and muscles were predictors of copepod survival. However, we found no effect of the parasite infection on muscles or lipids, and no indication of a change in resource allocation between these tissues. Our study suggests that behavioural changes in infected copepods are mediated by a mechanism different from energy depletion or a re-allocation of resources between muscles and lipids. We rather propose that the tapeworms directly manipulate copepod behaviour.},

  abstract = {Parasitism is the most common animal lifestyle, yet food webs rarely include parasites. The few earlier studies have indicated that including parasites leads to obvious increases in species richness, number of links, and food chain length. A less obvious result was that adding parasites slightly reduced connectance, a key metric considered to affect food web stability. However, reported reductions in connectance after the addition of parasites resulted from an inappropriate calculation. Two alternative corrective approaches applied to four published studies yield an opposite result: parasites increase connectance, sometimes dramatically. In addition, we find that parasites can greatly affect other food web statistics, such as nestedness (asymmetry of interactions), chain length, and linkage density. Furthermore, whereas most food webs find that top trophic levels are least vulnerable to natural enemies, the inclusion of parasites revealed that mid-trophic levels, not low trophic levels, suffered the highest vulnerability to natural enemies. These results show that food webs are very incomplete without parasites. Most notably, recognition of parasite links may have important consequences for ecosystem stability because they can increase connectance and nestedness.},

  abstract = {Trait evolution in predator–prey systems can feed back to the dynamics of interacting species as well as cascade to impact the dynamics of indirectly linked species (eco-evolutionary trophic cascades; EETCs). A key mediator of trophic cascades is body mass, as it both strongly influences and evolves in response to predator–prey interactions. Here, we use Gillespie eco-evolutionary models to explore EETCs resulting from top predator loss and mediated by body mass evolution. Our four-trophic-level food chain model uses allometric scaling to link body mass to different functions (ecological pleiotropy) and is realistically parameterized from the FORAGE database to mimic the parameter space of a typical freshwater system. To track real-time changes in selective pressures, we also calculated fitness gradients for each trophic level. As predicted, top predator loss generated alternating shifts in abundance across trophic levels, and, depending on the nature and strength in changes to fitness gradients, also altered trajectories of body mass evolution. Although more distantly linked, changes in the abundance of top predators still affected the eco-evolutionary dynamics of the basal producers, in part because of their relatively short generation times. Overall, our results suggest that impacts on top predators can set off transient EETCs with the potential for widespread indirect impacts on food webs.},

  abstract = {The next chapter of the robotics revolution is well underway with the deployment of robots for a broad range of commercial use cases. Even in a myriad of applications and environments, there exists a common vocabulary of components that robots share—the need for a modular, scalable, and reliable architecture; sensing; planning; mobility; and autonomy. The Robot Operating System (ROS) was an integral part of the last chapter, demonstrably expediting robotics research with freely available components and a modular framework. However, ROS 1 was not designed with many necessary production-grade features and algorithms. ROS 2 and its related projects have been redesigned from the ground up to meet the challenges set forth by modern robotic systems in new and exploratory domains at all scales. In this Review, we highlight the philosophical and architectural changes of ROS 2 powering this new chapter in the robotics revolution. We also show through case studies the influence ROS 2 and its adoption has had on accelerating real robot systems to reliable deployment in an assortment of challenging environments.           ,              This Review describes ROS 2’s design, features, and performance with four case studies on land, air, sea, and even space.},

  abstract = {Cyclopoid copepods have proved more effective for practical mosquito control than any other invertebrate predator of mosquito larvae. Their operational potential is enhanced by the fact that mass production is relatively easy and inexpensive. The exceptional potential of copepods for mosquito control was first realized about 25 years ago. Since then, laboratory experiments with copepods and mosquito larvae around the world have shown: Only the larger copepod species (body length {$>$} 1.4 mm) are of practical use for mosquito control. They kill mainly 1st instar mosquitoes. The most effective species have the capacity to kill more than 40 Aedes larvae/copepod/day. They generally kill fewer Anopheles larvae and even fewer Culex larvae.Most field testing of copepods has been in Aedes container-breeding habitats. Field tests have shown that: The most effective copepod species maintain large populations in a container habitat for as long as there is water. They typically reduce Aedes production by 99–100\%. They can cause local eradication of container-breeding Aedes mosquitoes if present in a high percentage of breeding sites.Field surveys in Anopheles, floodwater Aedes, and Culex breeding habitats have shown that natural copepod populations can substantially reduce, or even eliminate, mosquito production. Field trials in temporary pools, marshes, and rice fields have demonstrated that introduction of the right copepod species to the right habitat at the right time can eliminate Anopheles or floodwater Aedes larvae. As a rule, copepods cannot eliminate Culex production by themselves, but they can reinforce and augment control by other methods.The only large-scale operational use of copepods to date has been in Vietnam, which has achieved local eradication of Ae. aegypti in hundreds of villages. Conditions in Vietnam are particularly favorable because: Many Ae. aegypti breeding sites are water storage containers that are conspicuous and easily treated. Motivation to maintain copepods in containers for Ae. aegypti control is strong because of the high incidence of dengue hemorrhagic fever. Copepod use is effectively managed by women's associations already experienced with neighborhood health services.Copepods have the potential for local eradication of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in many other countries besides Vietnam. Professional capacity for copepod management and social institutions for community participation to help with implementation and maintenance are the main factors limiting broader use of copepods for operational mosquito control at the present time.},

The predator was highly efficient in controlling mosquitoes in all three settings, reaching close to 90\% reduction in larval survival under field conditions and exceeding the recommended predation rates for effective mosquito control in laboratory experiments. The predator was most effective on 1-4-d-old larvae. Alternate food and habitat structure significantly influenced the predation rates on mosquito larvae. Once established, the copepod was able to maintain reproducing populations in the field for the duration of the experiments. However, the predator failed to establish populations at four of the experimental field sites. Two of the failures can be attributed to characteristics of the individual tires, such as leaching chemicals, whereas the other two were probably due to site-specific factors. This copepod species is a promising candidate for control of mosquito larvae because it is a widespread and highly effective predator that is capable of establishing and maintaining populations under a wide variety of field conditions. Additionally, M. albidus is relatively easy to culture, maintain, and deliver to the target areas.}

However, recent research suggests that understudied non-consumptive interactions, such as behaviourally mediated indirect interactions (BMIIs), can influence marine ecosystems as much as consumptive effects. Here, we show, to our knowledge, the first experimental evidence and quantification of bottom-up BMIIs in plankton food webs. We used observational, modelling and experimental approaches to investigate how behavioural responses to resource availability influence predation mortality on grazers with different foraging strategies (ambushing versus active foraging). A three-level food chain was used: phytoplankton as resource, copepod nauplii as grazers of phytoplankton and a large copepod as a predator. Ambushers showed little change in foraging activity with resource availability, whereas active foragers decreased their foraging activity with increasing resources, which led to a decrease (24–50\%) in predation mortality. Therefore, an increase in resources (‘initiator’) causes behavioural changes in active grazers (‘transmitter’), which ultimately negatively affects predator (‘receiver’) consumption rates. Consequently, increase in resource abundance may result in decreasing energy transfer to higher trophic levels. These results indicate that behaviourally mediated interactions drive marine food web dynamics differently from that predicted by only density-mediated or consumptive interactions.},

  abstract = {The cestode Schistocephalus solidus is a simultaneous   hermaphrodite that grows in 2 intermediate hosts and reproduces  rapidly within a few days in the gut of a bird. Reproduction takes place   by self- or cross-fertilization. Here, it was tested  whether egg production differs between S. solidus that  reproduce alone and those that are allowed to reproduce in pairs.  Egg production in an in vitro system was found to depend  on the cestodes' social situation. When kept alone, larger  cestodes produced larger eggs. This was not so when kept in pairs  – the difference between these 2 reproductive modes  being highly significant in this respect. Further experiments revealed   that, within the first 3 days, these hermaphrodites  produced a larger total egg mass when kept alone than when kept in  pairs. This was also reflected by the energy contents  of the cestodes after this time-span: selfers had used up more energy  than paired worms. Furthermore, S. solidus appeared  to adjust its investment per egg depending on whether the  offspring will be the result of self- or cross-fertilization. Selfers  produced larger numbers of eggs, but these eggs were smaller and  contained even smaller embryos per given egg size than  eggs of potentially outbreeding cestodes. Selfed eggs reached lower  hatching rates. Although this is to be expected from  inbreeding depression it may also be an effect of the reduced maternal   investment per egg. The observed phenotypic  plasticity in the reproduction of S. solidus is discussed within   4 evolutionary frameworks: local mate competition adjusted  for hermaphrodites, the hermaphrodite's dilemma, bet-hedging, and  sib-competition.},

  abstract = {In an experiment to study the infectivity, growth and virulence  of  Schistocephalus solidus in their first intermediate host,  copepods of the species Macrocyclops albidus were kept  singly and exposed to up to 9 coracidia. Eleven or 14 days post-infection  (p.i.) the presence and growth of the cestode larvae relative to  survival, growth and reproduction of their host  was determined. As expected, the probability of a copepod becoming infected  increased with increasing numbers of  parasites administered. However, the chances of a single coracidium  establishing in a copepod also increased with  increasing numbers of coracidia administered, which indicates that the  parasites profit from a dilution effect of the host's  defence. Copepod size or developmental stage had no significant effect  on  the infection, but 14 days p.i., constraining  effects of copepod size on the growth of the parasites were apparent.  Moreover, procercoids in multiple infections grew  smaller and developed their cercomer at a smaller size than those in  single infections. No significant effect of the parasite  on host mortality was found within the observation period. However, growth  between the 5th copepodid stage and adult  stage was negatively affected by infection. An infection with  S. solidus was also strongly linked with host reproduction:  infected females were more likely to bear an egg sac at the end of the  experiment than non-infected ones. These egg sacs,  however, contained fewer eggs.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY                            Trophically-transmitted parasites generally need to undergo a period of development in the intermediate host before reaching infectivity. During this vulnerable period, manipulation of the host to reduce susceptibility to predation would be advantageous for parasites, because it increases the probability of surviving until infectivity and thus the probability of transmission. We tested this ‘predation suppression’ hypothesis in 2 parasite species that use copepods as first hosts: the tapeworm               Schistocephalus solidus               and the nematode               Camallanus lacustris               . In a series of prey choice experiments, we found that copepods harbouring uninfective, still-developing worm larvae were less frequently consumed by stickleback predators than uninfected copepods. The levels of predation suppression were similar in the two parasite species, suggestive of convergent evolution. Additionally, copepods harbouring 2 worms of a given species were not more susceptible to predation than those with 1 worm, suggesting that excessive larval parasite growth does not increase host susceptibility to predation. Our results support the idea that parasites can suppress intermediate host susceptibility to predation while uninfective, but we also note that the available studies suggest that this effect is weaker than the frequently observed enhancement of host predation by infective helminth larvae.},
