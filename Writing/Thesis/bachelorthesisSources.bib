  abstract = {Future challenges in manufacturing will require automation systems with robots that are increasingly autonomous, flexible, and hopefully equipped with learning capabilities. The flexibility of production processes can be increased by using a combination of a flexible human worker and intelligent automation systems. The adoption of middleware software such as ROS2, the second generation of the Robot Operating System, can enable robots, automation systems, and humans to work together on tasks that require greater autonomy and flexibility. This paper has a twofold objective. Firstly, it provides an extensive review of existing literature on the features and tools currently provided by ROS2 and its main fields of application, in order to highlight the enabling aspects for the implementation of modular architectures to increase autonomy in industrial operations. Secondly, it shows how this is currently potentially feasible in ROS2 by proposing a possible high-level and modular architecture to increase autonomy in industrial operations. A proof of concept is also provided, where the ROS2-based framework is used to enable a cobot equipped with an external depth camera to perform a flexible pick-and-place task.},

  abstract = {Developments in mobile robot navigation have enabled robots to operate in warehouses, retail stores, and on sidewalks around pedestrians. Various navigation solutions have been proposed, though few as widely adopted as ROS Navigation. 10 years on, it is still one of the most popular navigation solutions. Yet, ROS Navigation has failed to keep up with modern trends. We propose the new navigation solution, Navigation2, which builds on the successful legacy of ROS Navigation. Navigation2 uses a behavior tree for navigator task orchestration and employs new methods designed for dynamic environments applicable to a wider variety of modern sensors. It is built on top of ROS2, a secure message passing framework suitable for safety critical applications and program lifecycle management. We present experiments in a campus setting utilizing Navigation2 to operate safely alongside students over a marathon as an extension of the experiment proposed in Eppstein et al. The Navigation2 system is freely available at https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2 with a rich community and instructions.},

  abstract = {The next chapter of the robotics revolution is well underway with the deployment of robots for a broad range of commercial use cases. Even in a myriad of applications and environments, there exists a common vocabulary of components that robots share—the need for a modular, scalable, and reliable architecture; sensing; planning; mobility; and autonomy. The Robot Operating System (ROS) was an integral part of the last chapter, demonstrably expediting robotics research with freely available components and a modular framework. However, ROS 1 was not designed with many necessary production-grade features and algorithms. ROS 2 and its related projects have been redesigned from the ground up to meet the challenges set forth by modern robotic systems in new and exploratory domains at all scales. In this Review, we highlight the philosophical and architectural changes of ROS 2 powering this new chapter in the robotics revolution. We also show through case studies the influence ROS 2 and its adoption has had on accelerating real robot systems to reliable deployment in an assortment of challenging environments.           ,              This Review describes ROS 2’s design, features, and performance with four case studies on land, air, sea, and even space.},

	abstract = {Abstract             The book presents the case that cognitive science should turn its attention to developing theories of human cognition that cover the full range of human perceptual, cognitive, and action phenomena. Cognitive science has now produced a massive number of high-quality regularities with many microtheories that reveal important mechanisms. The need for integration is pressing and will continue to increase. Equally important, cognitive science now has the theoretical concepts and tools to support serious attempts at unified theories. The argument is made entirely by presenting an exemplar unified theory of cognition both to show what a real unified theory would be like and to provide convincing evidence that such theories are feasible. The exemplar is SOAR, a cognitive architecture, which is realized as a software system. After a detailed discussion of the architecture and its properties, with its relation to the constraints on cognition in the real world and to existing ideas in cognitive science, SOAR is used as theory for a wide range of cognitive phenomena: immediate responses (stimulus-response compatibility and the Sternberg phenomena); discrete motor skills (transcription typing); memory and learning (episodic memory and the acquisition of skill through practice); problem solving (cryptarithmetic puzzles and syllogistic reasoning); language (sentence verification and taking instructions); and development (transitions in the balance beam task). The treatments vary in depth and adequacy, but they clearly reveal a single, highly specific, operational theory that works over the entire range of human cognition, SOAR is presented as an exemplar unified theory, not as the sole candidate. Cognitive science is not ready yet for a single theory – there must be multiple attempts. But cognitive science must begin to work toward such unified theories.},
